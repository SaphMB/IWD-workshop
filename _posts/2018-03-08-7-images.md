It gets a bit boring staring at plain text so lets make our site more exciting with some images.

Images are made up of three attributes:

* the `<img>` tag
* the `src` attribute, which lets the page know what image we want to view
* the `alt` attribute, this provides extra information if the image cannot be seen on the webpage for any reason

In order for us to see an image on the webpage we need to link to the image, this involves telling the webpage where it is and what it is called. After the main heading of the page, add the following:

```
<div>
    <img src="https://github.com/SaphMB/iwd-workshop/blob/master/images/dorothy-vaughan.jpg?raw=true" alt="dorothy-vaughan" >
</div>
```

You can also add `align` to yor image tag to align your image to the left or right. eg 

`<img src="https://github.com/SaphMB/iwd-workshop/blob/master/images/dorothy-vaughan.jpg?raw=true" alt="dorothy-vaughan" align="right" >`

Here are a few more images you can add to your page:
